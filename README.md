👋 Hi there! I’m Ana 🌱  
I'm on a journey to learn and grow as a developer.  
Currently diving into C++ and Java, exploring how things work under the hood 🧠💻  

I believe in learning by building, breaking things, and asking questions.  
This space is where I share my experiments, projects, and progress — feel free to follow along or connect! 😊
